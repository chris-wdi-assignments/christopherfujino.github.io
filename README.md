# Christopher Fujino's Portfolio

With this project, I decided to try for a minimalistic approach. I wrote all css myself (other than a css normalization and Font Awesome for icons), wrote all the code in VanillaJS, and used a black & white & grey aesthetic.

## Dependencies

Uses [Nicolas Gallagher's normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css), [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.io) for icons and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting.
